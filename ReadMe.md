# Neighborhood Map Project

## How to use the app?

There are two ways :

* Download the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/Santiago-Correa-Dev/NeighborhoodMapper/archive/master.zip)
* You can open up the [app](https://santiago-correa-dev.github.io/NeighborhoodMapper/) directly in your browser.

### Key Instructions

There are aliens on the map, but don't be alarmed they come in peace.

* Each alien defines a spot I like to go.
* If you click on an alien, it will show you an info window with the name of the place and one nearby place.
* You can also filter places by searching in the input box or just click on a name on the list below to select an alien.


#### How did I get the info.

* All thanks to Foursquare's [API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)
* The all so awesome Google Map's [API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
